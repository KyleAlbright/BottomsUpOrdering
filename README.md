## Project Requirements
```
Your group will use everything youâ€™ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provide you with the best opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see during interviews. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

* Use React for the front end.

* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```

### [Description](#table-of-contents)
In this application we where able to satisfy the user's needs. When opening the app, you will be presented with the homepage, that will give you the option to send a message, or log in. Only when you are logged in, will you be able to view products, add them to a cart and make purchases. Once you have completed a purchase you will be presented with a success screen that will take you back to the homepage. 

### [Installation](#table-of-contents)
To install this please make sure that all dependencies have been downloaded. Once all items have been downloaded, you should be able to run the project by running "npm run develop" in the terminal. Dont forget to seed your database as well by running "npm run seed" in the terminal.

### [Usage](#table-of-contents)
This app was designed for use on both mobile and desktop platforms. Navigation elements will be in the drawer menu on smaller screens. For first time users, the option to register as a user will be presented as a separate tab login screen. On contact form you will be prompted to add your name and email to send a message. Once the message is sent you will receive verification that it went through. In the product screen you will be able to view all products alphabetically. If the user chooses they may narrow their search by selecting a category from the dropdown menu. When the user selects a product, they are taken to that that individual product screen. From here the user should be able to choose if they would like to add this product to their cart, and how many they would like. When the user clicks view cart, they are able to view all items in the cart, change quantities, and remove items from cart. When the user is ready to checkout they are presented with a screen hosted by Stripe. Once the user has inputted all their information, they will be able to purchase their products. After purchase has completed, the user is taken to a success screen where they can click a button to go back to the home screen. At any point if the user logs out, all items in the cart will be removed.
